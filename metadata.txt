about=The PDOK BAG connector creates a live link to the PDOK BAG WFS service, side stepping the problems with the normal QGIS WFS connection. The plugin adds a vector layer to the map. For this it uses the extent of the map as a bounding box. The plugin uses response paging to get all features in the bounding box. Unlike the QGIS WFS connector the attribute table and 'Save as ...' dialog respect the bounding box and won't try to download all features in the services. Via the properties of the added layer additional filtering can be set on the layer. The filters will be forwarded to the service so only the resulting features are downloaded.
